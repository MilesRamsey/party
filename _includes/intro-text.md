I'm a young professional living in [downtown Salt Lake City](https://twitter.com/downtownslc). Currently I work as a Senior Developer at [Salesforce Commerce Cloud](https://twitter.com/commercecloud) working on point of sale software. In my free time I enjoy playing [dodgeball](/assets/dodgeball.jpg) and [kickball](/assets/kickball.jpg), playing retro video games, and most recently [collecting vinyl](/assets/vinyl.jpg). I always like to have a book to read, and currently it's [Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll](http://a.co/fRYfcJR). I'm always looking for something new to learn, and am currently pursuing getting a Master's Degree.
