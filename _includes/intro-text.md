Hey everyone, last year's party was awesome and everyone survived and the building didn't burn down, so once again I'm throwing a party to celebrate the holidays (and me moving into my new place). Come have fun, bring some food or booze (last year we had stuff like shrimp cocktail, christmas cookies, homebrew, etc). I realize everyone's buzy during during the holiday season with work parties, family, and everything, so if you can't make it no worries, we'll just have to hang out another time.

  <h3>How to get there and into the building </h3>
  
  Here's the address:
  <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/NrHDyuq8Lu8n2gUt7">360 W Broadway #602</a>
  
  <h4>Entering the building:</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>To enter the building use code <b>3-1-5-4-#</b> that's <b>three-one-five-four-pound/hash sign</b>.</li>
  <li>The elevator only works for residents, so you'll have to <b>take the stairs</b> to the top (floor #6), my place is on the west side #602.</li>
  </ul>
    
  
  <h4>Parking:</h4>
  I'd recommend taking a Lyft/Uber especially if you plan on drinking. Parking is a free for all, there's usually some public parking spaces right in front of the building that don't cost money from 6pm to 8am.
